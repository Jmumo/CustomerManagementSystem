## 🧪 Test Data Workflow

Follow the steps below to manually test the application using `curl`.

### Step 1: Create a Customer

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/customers \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "firstName": "John",
        "lastName": "Doe",
        "email": "john.doe@example.com",
        "phoneNumber": "0712345678"
      }'
```

✅ *Response will contain the `publicId` of the created customer.*

---

### Step 2: Create an Account using Customer Public ID

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/accounts \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "customerPublicId": "PASTE_CUSTOMER_PUBLIC_ID_HERE",
        "accountType": "SAVINGS",
        "currency": "KES"
      }'
```

✅ *Response will contain the `publicId` of the created account.*

---

### Step 3: Create a Card using Account Public ID

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/cards \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "accountPublicId": "PASTE_ACCOUNT_PUBLIC_ID_HERE",
        "cardType": "VISA"
      }'
